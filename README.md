# Cognitive Canvas

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that transforms AI assistants into research-grade cognitive workspaces with systematic reasoning, evidence-based analysis, persistent memory management, and intelligent knowledge discovery.

## Overview

Cognitive Canvas is an advanced MCP server that provides AI agents with human-like organizational abilities for complex problem-solving. It transforms simple chat assistants into sophisticated research agents capable of systematic thinking, statistical evidence generation, persistent knowledge building, and intelligent knowledge retrieval through semantic search.

**Core Philosophy**: Transform any AI from a basic chat interface into a comprehensive research laboratory with structured reasoning, dependency mapping, statistical validation, context management, and intelligent knowledge discovery capabilities.

### Key Transformations

**From Simple Chat to Research Agent**
- Before: AI gives quick answers and forgets context
- After: AI builds knowledge systematically, maintains research state, develops insights over time, and discovers relevant past solutions

**From Linear Responses to Deep-Thinking Mode**
- Before: AI provides immediate, surface-level responses
- After: AI breaks down complex problems, maps dependencies, validates hypotheses with statistical evidence, and leverages historical knowledge

**From Stateless to Persistent Intelligence**
- Before: Each conversation starts from scratch
- After: AI accumulates knowledge, tracks progress, maintains statistical evidence, builds upon previous work, and discovers relevant past insights through semantic search

**From Opinion-Based to Evidence-Driven**
- Before: AI provides subjective recommendations
- After: AI generates statistical evidence, calculates significance levels, provides data-backed conclusions, and leverages documented solutions from past experiences

**From Isolated Knowledge to Connected Intelligence**
- Before: AI cannot access or learn from previous problem-solving sessions
- After: AI searches through accumulated knowledge using semantic similarity, finds relevant solutions even with partial matches, and builds upon documented experiences

## Example Prompts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### Command Not Found Error
If you get "cognitive-canvas-mcp command not found":

1. **Check Python Scripts Path**: Ensure your Python Scripts folder is in PATH
2. **Use Alternative Configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "cognitive-canvas": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["-m", "cognitive_canvas_server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

#### Import Errors
If you encounter import errors:

1. **Verify Installation**: Run `pip list | grep cognitive-canvas`
2. **Reinstall Package**: `pip uninstall cognitive-canvas-mcp && pip install cognitive-canvas-mcp`
3. **Check Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed

#### MCP Server Connection Issues
If the MCP server fails to connect:

1. **Check Configuration File**: Verify JSON syntax in your MCP client config
2. **Test Server Manually**: Run `python cognitive_canvas_server.py` directly
3. **Check Logs**: Look for error messages in your MCP client logs
4. **Verify Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Performance Issues

#### Memory Usage
If experiencing high memory usage:
- Cognitive Canvas stores data in memory for fast access
- Data is conversation-scoped and automatically cleaned up
- For large datasets, consider breaking analysis into smaller chunks

#### Response Time
If tools respond slowly:
- Statistical analysis can be compute-intensive for large datasets
- Consider using batch operations for multiple analyses
- Complex diagrams with many nodes may take longer to render

### Tool-Specific Issues

#### Statistical Analyzer
- **Error: "Insufficient data"**: Ensure you have enough data points for the chosen analysis
- **Error: "Invalid data format"**: Check that your data is properly formatted (arrays for numerical, proper categories for categorical)
- **Unexpected results**: Verify your data doesn't contain missing values or outliers

#### Relationship Mapper
- **Diagram not rendering**: Check that all referenced nodes exist before adding edges
- **Complex diagrams unclear**: Consider breaking large diagrams into smaller, focused sub-diagrams

#### Task Management
- **Tasks not updating**: Ensure you're using the correct conversation_id and task_id
- **Batch operations failing**: Verify the task list format matches the expected structure

### Getting Help

#### Documentation
- Check the example prompts section for proper usage patterns
- Review the API documentation in the source code
- Look at test files for additional usage examples

#### Community Support
- Create an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/OsmondJiang/Cognitive-Canvas/issues
